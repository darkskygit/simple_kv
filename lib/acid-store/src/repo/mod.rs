//! High-level abstractions for data storage.
//!
//! This module provides abstractions for data storage called repositories. Each repository is
//! backed by a `DataStore`, and provides features like encryption, compression, deduplication,
//! integrity checking, locking, and atomic transactions.
//!
//! Repositories implement `OpenRepo`, which can be used to create a new repository or open an
//! existing one.
//!
//! `ObjectRepository` is the main repository type provided by this module. It's meant to be easily
//! extensible to fit most use-cases, and all other repository types are implemented on top of it.
//! The other repository types provided by this module can be found in sub-modules.
